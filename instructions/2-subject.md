# Phase 2. Formulating a research question

The assignment in this phase is easily described, but hard to carry out!

- Find a subject in the ICT world that, according to your opinion, is suitable to write a bachelor thesis about.
- Formulate a research question and subquestions.
- Write them down in the designated file: `notes/2-notes-subject.md`
- When you have made your final choice, you can write the introduction to the paper in the LaTeX document in the directory `paper/` (where you should have alreay adapted the name to your own).
