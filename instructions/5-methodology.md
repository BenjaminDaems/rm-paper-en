# Phase 5. Methodology.

- Write an action plan for your bachelor thesis in the Methodology section of the paper.
- Divide the process into different phases and describe in detail what you will do in each phase, why you are doing this and what the result should be. Avoid vague descriptions like "research", "carry out research", but try to be as precise as possible!
- Try to define a timing for each phase. A normal time schedule of a bachelor thesis starts together with the start of the 2nd semester and ends on the last Friday of the first exam week.
