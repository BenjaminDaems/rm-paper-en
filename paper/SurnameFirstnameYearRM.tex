% TODO: Are you also taking on the Bachelor's thesis this year? Then uncomment
% the text below and adjust it as appropriate.

%\paragraph{Remark}

% I'm also taking up the bachelor's thesis this year. The content of this research proposal also serves as the subject for my bachelor thesis. My promoter is (Mr./Mrs.) X.\ Surname.


% Describe any differences and/or improvements in this document compared to your research proposal that you submitted for the Bachelor's thesis.

\section{Introduction}%
\label{sec:Introduction}

% TODO: (phase 1) introduce your chosen topic, formulate the research question and sub-questions. What is the objective (is it S.M.A.R.T.?), what will be the result of the research (a Proof-of-Concept, a prototype, an advice, ...)? Why is it useful to research this topic?

\lipsum[1-3]

\section{Literature Review}%
\label{sec:literature review}

% TODO: (phase 3-4) write out the literature review and use references to authoritative professional literature where appropriate.

% Use the following commands to cite references:
% \autocite{BIBTEXKEY} -> (Author, year)
% \textcite{BIBTEXKEY} -> Author (year)
Example of a reference where the author's name is not part of the sentence~\autocite{Moore2002}. Be aware that a citation belongs INSIDE the sentence, and in the first sentence that references that source. NEVER use the cite commands outside of a sentence, or at the end of a long paragraph.

\lipsum[4-9]

\section{Methodology}%
\label{sec:methodology}

% TODO: (phase 5) describe in detail which phases your research can be divided into, how long each phase lasts and what the concrete result of each phase is. What research technique will you use to answer each of your research questions? Do you use experiments, questionnaires, simulations for this? You also describe which tools you intend to use or develop for this. Include a flowchart or Gantt-chart to illustrate your planning.

\lipsum[10-12]

\section{Expected results}%
\label{sec:expected-results}

% TODO: (phase 6) describe what you expect from your research and why (e.g. according to your literature search software package A is the most used and you think it will be most suitable for this case). Of course you can't look into the future and you can't rule out alternative possibilities. In practice, it often happens that research leads to surprising results, which makes the process even more interesting!
