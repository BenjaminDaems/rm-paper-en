Men and women may benefit differently from social relationships because of cultural differences in gender roles. Psychosocial mechanisms such as social support, which may explain the effects of social networks, may also vary by culture.},

  title    = {[Effects of social activities on life satisfaction among the
              elderly: four aspects in men and women]},
  author   = {Okamoto, Hideaki},
  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The current study was performed to examine
              relationships between different aspects of social activities and
              life satisfaction among the elderly. This issue was investigated
              in men and women separately. METHODS: Data for 612 older adults
              aged 65 to 84 years were obtained from a mail survey in an urban
              area. Life satisfaction was measured using the LSIK and social
              activities were assessed by asking respondents their degree of
              participation in each type of interaction. The focus was on four
              aspects: personal activities, socially-related activities,
              learning activities, and job activity. In order to examine
              relationships between different aspects of social activities and
              life satisfaction, the author used multiple regression analyses
              with the four types of social activity level as independent
              variables. All except job activity were categorized as lower,
              middle and higher levels, and work was categorized as low and
              high. Two models of multiple regression were employed. First,
              each of the four aspects of social activity was entered as an
              independent variable (Model 1); second, four aspects of social
              activity were entered as independent variables simultaneously
              (Model 2). The analyses were conducted separately for men and
              women, controlling for age, marital status, subjective economic
              status and IADL (instrumental activities of daily living).
              RESULTS: (1) The results of the multiple regression analyses
              (Model 1) were as follows: for both men and women, personal
              activities were positively associated with life satisfaction. For
              women, socially-related activities were also positively related
              to life satisfaction. For both men and women, learning activities
              and job activity exhibited statistically nonsignificant
              relationships with life satisfaction. (2) With Model 2, the
              results were as follows: among men, none of the aspects of social
              activity was significantly associated with life satisfaction.
              Among women, only personal activities were positively associated
              with life satisfaction. CONCLUSION: When all other aspects of
              social activity, sociodemographic and IADL factors were
              controlled, older women with higher levels of engagement in
              personal activities had greater life satisfaction, whereas among
              men, none of the aspects of social activity was significantly
              related to life satisfaction.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes an experimental study on the detection of emotion from speech. As computer-based characters such as avatars and virtual chat faces become more common, the use of emotion to drive the expression of the virtual characters becomes more important. This study utilizes a corpus containing emotional speech with 721 short utterances expressing four emotions: anger, happiness, sadness, and the neutral (unemotional) state, which were captured manually from movies and teleplays. We introduce a new concept to evaluate emotions in speech. Emotions are so complex that most speech sentences cannot be precisely assigned to a particular emotion category; however, most emotional states nevertheless can be described as a mixture of multiple emotions. Based on this concept we have trained SVMs (support vector machines) to recognize utterances within these four categories and developed an agent that can recognize and express emotions.},
